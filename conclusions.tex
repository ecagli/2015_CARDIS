\section{Conclusion and Future Developments}\label{sec:conclusions}

In this paper we studied and compared two well-known techniques to construct extractors for SC traces, the PCA and the LDA. In our comparison framework we confirmed what expected by theoretical facts: the LDA method is much more adequate that the PCA one, thanks to its class-distinguishing asset. Aware of the choice component issue linked to the PCA, and observed in two different real case contexts, we proposed a new selection method, based on the ELV notion. Thanks to this technique the class-oriented PCA can achieve in some cases ({\em e.g} with our test trace set) performances comparable to those of the LDA. Moreover, it remains a good alternative to LDA when the SSS problem occurs, together with Direct LDA and the $SW$ Null Space Method, which are some of the methods we proposed to test in SC context and whose purpose is to find LDCs when the SSS problem makes the LDA infeasible. Such methods seem promising.

 %and a deeper analysis is left for the future, together with the inclusion in this comparative study of a third projecting extractor, called {\em Projection Pursuits} CITAZIONE
